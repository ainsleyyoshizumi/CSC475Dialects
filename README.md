#CSC475 Seminar Spring Project 

### Hello, my name is Ainsley Yoshizumi. I am a senior at Furman University 
who is currently working on a program aimed at using natural language processing
technology to identify different Spanish dialects. 

## Background
### Following Mandarin, Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world. The
diffusion of the Spanish language started with the expansion of imperial Spain. Today, Spanish is
spoken on four continents including the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Over time Spanish
has diverged into many different dialects, indigenous and non-indigenous. Some popular dialects
in Spain include Catalan and Castilian. In Latin America, there is Mexican Spanish, Argentinian
Spanish, Chilean Spanish, the list goes on and on. A common misconception when it comes to
Spanish speakers is one considering Spanish as the sole language or dialect being spoken. However,
Spanish is incredibly diverse. The many variations illustrate the lack of research and understanding
surrounding the language’s diversity. Studying Spanish and its morphology can unlock many new
insights and perspectives on the culture and sounds of the language. [1] [2] [3]

## Goal
### To explore the many different sounds of Spanish and its dialects, I want to create a speech
recognition machine that can decipher between a small number of different Spanish dialects. In
my Spanish linguistics class, we have been primarily concerned with the difference in sounds
between different Spanish dialects. This program I am aiming to create could potentially increase the
understanding between different dialects, highlighting the subtle differences in pronunciation, syntax,
and lexicology.

## Data 
### The dataset I will be building my language processor on will be a language-resource repository
on GitHub. The repository is full of zip audio files of different languages being spoken. The files I
am interested in cover Argentinean, Catalonian, Chilean, Colombian, Peruvian, Puerto Rican, and
Venezuelan dialects. They are large zip files published three years ago that have short clips of Spanish
speakers saying various short phrases about the weather in Spanish. The repository is a free publicly
available resource with various contributing authors who have created these datasets for research and
published them online for anyone to use. [4]

## Methods
### I will need to create a program that takes audio inputs and processes them to categorize
them as a dialect. I will need to be able to parse through the audio and apply semantic analysis, as
this will be a very key part of the program’s ability to differentiate between the different dialects. I
would like my application to be a variant of the Google speech application available online. This
application allows the user to speak when prompted and allows the user to practice their pronunciation
of different words, with Google checking to see if they pronounced the word correctly or not. This
style of this application is very simple and allows for a convenient user experience. I would like to
create something visually similar to this feature.

## Evaluation
### I will measure the success of my program through a mixture of both qualitative and
quantitative approaches. I will be recording the accuracy of my program as a percentage to assess if a machine can be effective in classifying different Spanish dialects. The qualitative approach
will concern areas of the project surrounding my overall observations and experience of crossing
technology and linguistics. By the end of the course, my project will ideally contribute to linguists
researching the many different Spanish dialects and what makes each different either morphologically,
phonetically, or grammatically.

## Dissemination
### My project deliverables will be the software application and the code written to
create it. The software and final code will also be available publicly online, I am very open to the
idea of publishing my project to a pre-print server, as one main goal of my project is to contribute to
the ongoing research in Spanish linguistics. I would like to present my project with a demo using my
computer at Furman Engaged, in addition to the course presentation and poster presentation.
